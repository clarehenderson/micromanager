Enter any combination of MATLAB-style ranges -- (min : max : step) --<br/>
and/or arrays of values -- [a, b, c] -- into each box. Make sure that<br/>
the number of generated values is as expected (data outside the above<br/>
formats is discarded silently!) and is equal for each device. Note<br/>
that unlike elsewhere, these rows don't cascade.
